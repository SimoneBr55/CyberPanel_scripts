## USAGE ##

You have to create a '.set_env_vars' file in which you declare all the environment variables you see in the scripts.

## Variables Details ##

_to do_

## ISSUES ##

Due to sudo password being asked, as of now, the script is not automatic and therefore cannote be cron'd. I setup a script (this one IS fully automatic which checks the ip address and notify the administrator (via pushbullet.py) that there is a discrepancy he must correct manually. The API key must be set in the env file.
Cheers
